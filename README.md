GPS Tracker Readme

Installation
------------
Make sure you have the .NET Framework installed.  You can get it from
    http://msdn.microsoft.com/netframework/technologyinfo/howtoget/default.aspx

Extract the files in this archive to a directory.

Usage
-----
```
gpstracker <file with NMEA data>
```

ie:

```
    gpstracker webtest.csv
```

This opens up a window that displays your track data.  Web sites like
Terraserver (http://terraserver.microsoft.com) will give you maps of the
area if you enter an address or Latitude / Longitude.

Once you've got the map on screen, resize the GPS Tracker window until
it fits.
